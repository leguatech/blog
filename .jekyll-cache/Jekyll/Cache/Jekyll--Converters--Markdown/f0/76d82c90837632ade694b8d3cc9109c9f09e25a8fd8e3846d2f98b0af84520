I"⁄<p>Severe allergic reactions (Anaphylaxis) in children are very common in clinic, involving multiple systems such as digestive tract, respiratory tract, skin and mucous membranes, otolaryngology, etc. This article mainly refers to the main domestic and foreign guidelines, from a clinical perspective, clear how to make early judgments and emergency treatment.</p>

<h2 id="severe-allergic-reaction-dont-just-think-of-anaphylactic-shock">Severe allergic reactionÔºö Don‚Äôt just think of anaphylactic shock</h2>
<p>European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, EAACI, defined severe allergic reaction: ‚ÄúSerious, life-threatening systemic allergic reaction‚Äù.</p>

<p>The clinical features are rapid and life-threatening respiratory and circulatory problems, which are not always accompanied by related changes in skin and mucous membranes.</p>

<p>The definition of the Pediatrics Branch of the Chinese Medical Association is: a life-threatening severe syndrome that occurs rapidly within minutes to hours after exposure to allergens, involving two or more organs and (or) systems, and anaphylactic shock can occur in severe cases , Must be given emergency treatment.</p>

<p>The definitions used in the recommendations of the First Aid Guide for Severe Allergic Reactions in China are:</p>

<p>Sudden, severe and life-threatening allergic reactions after the body is exposed to allergens. Its main clinical feature is the rapid occurrence of life-threatening respiratory and / or circulatory problems, and in most cases, symptoms of the skin and mucous membrane system.</p>

<p>It can be seen that although the definitions are not the same, the common characteristics are: systemic clinical emergency, which involves at least 2 systems or organs, is life-threatening, requires urgent treatment, and is not necessarily accompanied by skin and mucous membrane symptoms.</p>

<p>Through the concept we can also conclude: severe allergic reaction ‚â† anaphylactic shock. The former concept includes the latter, while the latter emphasizes the abnormality of the circulatory system. Once the circulatory system is involved, reprocessing may delay the rescue. In order to improve the timeliness of rescue, the concept of severe allergic reaction is earlier than the anaphylactic shock rescue threshold, emphasizing early recognition and treatment.</p>

<h2 id="severe-allergic-reactions-progress-rapidly">Severe allergic reactions progress rapidly</h2>
<p>After exposure to allergens, allergic reactions usually occur within 2 hours, food allergies usually occur within 30 minutes, and allergic reactions occur more quickly after injection of drugs or insect bites. In a series of life-threatening cases of severe allergic reactions, the median time from food allergies, insect venom allergies, and injection allergies to the occurrence of severe allergic reactions was 30, 15 and 5 minutes, respectively. Therefore, it is especially important to ask about the medical history in detail (food intake, drug application, outdoor activities, mosquito bites, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="allergic-reactions-can-affect-multiple-system-organs">Allergic reactions can affect multiple system organs</h2>

<p>A severe allergic reaction is a systemic syndrome involving multiple systems and / or organs. A 2012 patient study found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The skin is the most vulnerable organ (84%);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is followed by cardiovascular symptoms (72%) and airway symptoms (68%).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Another item of data for a total of 1865 patients [5] shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Skin involvement up to 90% (urticaria and angioedema 62% -90%, skin redness 45% -55%, no itching rash 2% -5%);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respiratory symptoms up to 60% (dyspnea, asthma 45% -50%, upper airway angioedema 50% -60%, rhinitis 15% -20%);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Circulatory system (hypotension, dizziness, syncope, excessive sweating) 30% -35%;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Digestive system (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) 25% -30%;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others: headache 5% -8%, posterior sternal pain 4% -5%, convulsions 1% -2%.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, based on the limited data of children, children‚Äôs skin performance should be rarer than adults.</p>

<p>Clinicians should pay attention to the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Digestive tract: spastic abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, etc .;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skin and mucous membranes: sudden systemic urticaria, itching, blushing, swelling of lips-tongue-uvula, etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respiratory system: wheezing, asthma, laborious breathing, continuous severe cough, cyanosis, etc .;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cardiovascular system: low blood pressure, arrhythmia, syncope, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once one of the above symptoms occurs, serious allergic reactions should be considered and urgent treatment is required.</p>

<h2 id="criteria-for-diagnosis-and-classification-of-severe-allergic-reactions">Criteria for diagnosis and classification of severe allergic reactions</h2>
<p>When the symptoms meet any of the following three criteria, the patient is most likely to have an acute severe allergic reaction.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The disease has an acute attack (within a few minutes to several hours), with skin and / or mucosal system symptoms, such as rash, itching or flushing, redness, numbness, etc., and any of the following system symptoms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A Respiratory symptoms, such as dumb tone, chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, bronchospasm, cyanosis, peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia, etc .;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>B. Decreased blood pressure, or related end organ dysfunction, such as numbness, hypotonia, syncope, incontinence, etc.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the patient is exposed to the suspected allergen, the following symptoms of 2 or more quickly occur within a few minutes to several hours</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A Skin and mucous membrane tissue symptoms, such as various rashes, itching or flushing, redness and / or numbness of lips and tongue, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>B. Respiratory symptoms, such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, bronchospasm, cyanosis, peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia, etc .;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>C Blood pressure drop or end organ function involvement, such as hypotonia, syncope, incontinence, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>D Continuous gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, etc.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After exposure to known allergens, the blood pressure drops within a few minutes to several hours.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A Infants and children: Systolic blood pressure is lower than the normal value of the corresponding age. Ôºú 1 year old, systolic blood pressure &lt;70; 1 ÔΩû 10 years old, systolic blood pressure Ôºú (70 + 2 √ó age); 11 ÔΩû 17 years old,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>B Adult: The systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg, or more than 30% lower than the baseline value.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-judge-the-severity">How to judge the severity?</h2>

<p>Class I: only skin and mucosal system symptoms and gastrointestinal system symptoms, stable hemodynamics and stable breathing;</p>

<p>Grade II: Obvious respiratory symptoms or decreased blood pressure;</p>

<p>Grade III: Any of the following symptoms: unconsciousness, drowsiness, loss of consciousness, severe bronchospasm and / or laryngeal edema, cyanosis, severe blood pressure drop (systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg or&gt; 40% decrease from baseline)</p>

<p>Class IV: Heartbeat and / or respiratory arrest occurs.</p>
