I"T<p>Yesterday, there were 136,987 close contacts in China, an increase of 21% compared with the previous day. Observing the data changes of close contacts can let us know some potential risks. Judging from the data of the past few days, close contacts are still on the rise, and we still cannot relax. However, with the implementation of “early discovery and early isolation”, we can also see that the growth rate of close contacts shows a significant downward trend. This is a good signal. When the growth rate of close contacts starts to show negative growth, it may be a better signal.</p>
