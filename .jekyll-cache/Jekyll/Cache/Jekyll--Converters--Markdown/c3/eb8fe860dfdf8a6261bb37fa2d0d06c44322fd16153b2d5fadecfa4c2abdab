I"<p>Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are currently the most commonly used antipyretics, but there are obvious differences between the two in terms of molecular structure, mechanism of action, contraindications, etc., and their use in different occasions has advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>So when should ibuprofen be used and when should acetaminophen be used? This is a question worth exploring.</p>

<h2 id="a-table-summary-the-difference-between-the-two-antipyretics">A table summary: the difference between the two antipyretics</h2>

<p>First, let’s understand the difference between acetaminophen and ibuprofen through a table:</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Mechanism</td>
      <td>By inhibiting cyclooxygenase, it selectively inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins in the hypothalamic body temperature regulation center, leading to the expansion of peripheral blood vessels and sweating to achieve antipyretic effect.</td>
      <td>By inhibiting the synthesis of hypothalamic prostaglandins, while stimulating vasopressin and melanocyte estrogen in the posterior pituitary, the heat dissipation process is increased, and the temperature control point of the body temperature is moved down to achieve the effect of fever reduction</td>
