I"ì<p>Colorectal cancer is one of the top five cancers in the world, and is usually found in the middle and late stages.</p>

<p>The data shows that the 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced colorectal cancer is only 12%. But if it can be found early, the 5-year survival rate after treatment can reach 90%.</p>

<p>The key to 90% and 12% is: early detection.</p>

<p>Almost all colorectal cancers are developed from colorectal adenoma, and the entire canceration process often takes more than ten years.</p>

<p>Its development process is probably like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the beginning, the tumor may be just an adenoma;</li>
  <li>After several years of development, the adenoma becomes cancerous and grows continuously;</li>
  <li>While continuing to grow, there is eventually a shift.</li>
</ul>
