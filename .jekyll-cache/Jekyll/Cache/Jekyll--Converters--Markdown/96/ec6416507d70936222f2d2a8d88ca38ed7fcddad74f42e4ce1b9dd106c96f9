I"@	<p>Colorectal cancer is one of the top five cancers in the world, and is usually found in the middle and late stages.</p>

<p>The data shows that the 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced colorectal cancer is only 12%. But if it can be found early, the 5-year survival rate after treatment can reach 90%.</p>

<p>The key to 90% and 12% is: early detection.</p>

<p>Almost all colorectal cancers are developed from colorectal adenoma, and the entire canceration process often takes more than ten years.</p>

<p>Its development process is probably like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the beginning, the tumor may be just an adenoma;</li>
  <li>After several years of development, the adenoma becomes cancerous and grows continuously;</li>
  <li>While continuing to grow, there is eventually a shift.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, some methods can help doctors discover it early in the cancer, even before it becomes cancerous.</p>

<p>As long as abnormal tissue is discovered and removed, the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer can be effectively prevented.</p>

<p>Early detection not only costs less, but also has a higher survival rate. If it is discovered until late, not only is it more dangerous, but the cost of treatment will also bring a huge financial burden to the family.</p>

<p>The 5-year survival rate after treatment of early colorectal cancer is as high as 90%, while in the late stage, it is only 12%.</p>

<p>Behind 90% and 12% are thousands of real families with different endings.</p>

<p>In the United States, the overall incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining for many years, from 56.0 (per 100,000) in 1998 to 36.5 (per 100,000) in 2015. Even worse, the mortality rate of colorectal cancer in the United States has been declining since the 1980s. In this regard, colorectal cancer screening is indispensable. Colorectal cancer, the third largest cancer in the United States, continues to decrease in incidence</p>
