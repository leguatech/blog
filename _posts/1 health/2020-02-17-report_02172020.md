Colorectal cancer is one of the top five cancers in the world, and is usually found in the middle and late stages.

The data shows that the 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced colorectal cancer is only 12%. But if it can be found early, the 5-year survival rate after treatment can reach 90%.

The key to 90% and 12% is: early detection.

## Colorectal cancer can be found very early

Almost all colorectal cancers are developed from colorectal adenoma, and the entire canceration process often takes more than ten years.


Its development process is probably like this:

- At the beginning, the tumor may be just an adenoma;
- After several years of development, the adenoma becomes cancerous and grows continuously;
- While continuing to grow, there is eventually a shift.

Fortunately, some methods can help doctors discover it early in the cancer, even before it becomes cancerous.



As long as abnormal tissue is discovered and removed, the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer can be effectively prevented.



Early detection not only costs less, but also has a higher survival rate. If it is discovered until late, not only is it more dangerous, but the cost of treatment will also bring a huge financial burden to the family.



The 5-year survival rate after treatment of early colorectal cancer is as high as 90%, while in the late stage, it is only 12%.



Behind 90% and 12% are thousands of real families with different endings.

## Colonoscopy, found a powerful weapon for colorectal cancer

In the United States, the overall incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining for many years, from 56.0 (per 100,000) in 1998 to 36.5 (per 100,000) in 2015. Even worse, the mortality rate of colorectal cancer in the United States has been declining since the 1980s. In this regard, colorectal cancer screening is indispensable. Colorectal cancer, the third largest cancer in the United States, continues to decrease in incidence.

There are 7 common screening methods: colonoscopy, immunological stool fecal occult blood, fecal guaiacylester test, sigmoidoscopy plus immunological stool fecal occult blood, colon CT imaging (virtual colonoscopy), multi-target stool DNA testing, separate Sigmoidoscopy.



Among them, colonoscopy can help doctors directly observe the internal situation of the colorectum, minimizing misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.



Compared with the more and more extensive colorectal cancer screening in the United States, domestic colorectal cancer screening is still in its infancy, especially colonoscopy, and the proportion is still very low.



Cancer screening means that people who meet the screening criteria should be screened when there are no symptoms.



If you do not screen in advance, but wait until you have symptoms to see a doctor, it may be too late.

## Don't be afraid of colonoscopy

Some people do n’t do colonoscopy because they do n’t know; some people do n’t do it because they are afraid of being too uncomfortable. In fact, everyone need not be afraid.


> Colonoscopy has discomfort, but can be tolerated

Everyone has different feelings and tolerance for pain. Colonoscopy does have discomfort such as bloating or stretching, but most people can tolerate and complete the examination smoothly.


> Colonoscopy does not need to be done every year



In general, if the first colonoscopy does not reveal abnormalities, then repeat the colonoscopy 10 years later. If abnormal conditions such as adenoma are found, check every 3 to 5 years. The specific inspection frequency follows the doctor's advice, but under normal circumstances it is not necessary to do it every year.



Once in a few years, although it will be a bit uncomfortable, but it can make you and your family feel at ease.

> Painless enteroscopy is a good option



With the development of medicine, anesthesia technology can now be used to reduce the pain caused by examinations. If you are really afraid of pain, you may wish to discuss with your doctor to book a painless colonoscopy.
