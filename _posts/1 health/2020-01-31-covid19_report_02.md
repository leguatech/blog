There were 1982 newly diagnosed cases yesterday, an increase of 26% compared with the previous day. There were 4812 new suspected cases yesterday, an increase of 25% compared with the previous day.Judging from the data after January 28th, although the daily increase in the number of suspected and newly diagnosed yesterday has decreased compared with the previous two days, the growth is still more than 20%. This data indicates that the epidemic situation is still on the rise.

### Two of the top ten cities with the largest number of diagnoses in China are not in Hubei Province

There are currently 307 confirmed cases in all of China, and 9 of these cities were the first confirmed cases yesterday. There were 122 newly diagnosed cases in 122 cities, accounting for 40% of 307 cities. Of the ten cities with the most confirmed cases, eight are in Hubei Province. The remaining two cities are Wenzhou City in Zhejiang Province and Chongqing City .

> The World Health Organization announced that the epidemic in China constitutes an “International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC)”. What does it mean?

The first thing that needs to be clear is that some people say that this means that China is included in the "endemic country", which is a wrong view. There is simply no concept of "endemic country". At present, WHO has not issued a statement that China is an epidemic area, and PHEIC is only a recommendation to countries, not a mandatory measure.

PHEIC is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue. It has been used 6 times since 2009, namely: 
- Influenza A H1N1 in 2009
- Poliomyelitis epidemic area in 2014
- Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014
- Zika outbreak from 2015 to 2016 
- New coronavirus epidemic in 2020

Earlier, WHO Director-General Tedros pointed out in the question after the press conference that the current International Health Regulations (2005) stipulates that it can only be selected as PHEIC or not, and there is no middle ground. He believes that the rules should be changed to take the form of red, yellow, and green lights, and there can be an intermediate situation between the red and green lights.
